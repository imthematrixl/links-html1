    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <br>
    <pre>        There goes my heart again
        All of this time, I thought we were pretending
        Nothing looks the same when your eyes are open
        Now you're playing these games to keep my heartbeat spinning


        You show me love, you show me love
        You show me everything my heart is capable of
        You reshape me like butterfly origami, yeah



        You have broken into my heart
        This time, I feel the blues have departed
        Nothing can keep me away from this feeling
        I know I am simply falling for you



        I'm taking time to envision where your heart is
        And justify why you're gone for the moment
        I tumble sometimes, looking for sunshine
        And you know this is right when you look into my eyes



        You show me love, you show me love
        You show me everything my heart is capable of
        And now I can't break away from this fire that we started



        You have broken into my heart
        This time, I feel the blues have departed
        Nothing can keep me away from this feeling
        I know I am simply falling for you



        There my heart goes again
        In your arms, I'm falling deeper
        And there's nothing to break me away from this



        You have broken into my heart
        This time, I feel the blues have departed
        Nothing can keep me away from this feeling
        I know I am simply falling



        You have broken into my heart
        This time, I feel the blues have departed
        Nothing can keep me away from this feeling
        I know I am simply falling for you



        There my heart goes again
        You have broken into my heart
        Oh, I'm falling deeper, I'm falling deeper</pre>
